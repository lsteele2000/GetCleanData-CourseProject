#Codebook for the project
Quick and dirty, with the exception of the subjectid and activity columns all columns are the mean of each original field which was selected from the original dataset grouped by subject and activity.

With the exception of the activity which is textual all columns are numeric.

See the README.txt file in the UCI HAR Dataset subdirectory for the meaning of the underlying columns.
